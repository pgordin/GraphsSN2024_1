    "Dinitz's algorithm is a method for solving the maximum flow problem (MFP) in a flow network. Named after it's creator: Yefim Dinitz, a computer scientist, it was published in the 1970s and it greatly revolutionized the approach to the Maximum Flow problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general flow networks (and therefore the maximum flow problem) have their use in many different scenarios across the world:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transportation systems: How much material can be transported from one place to another given road/vehicle capacities.\n",
    "- Electrical engineering: How much current can flow through a given circuit.\n",
    "- Network routing: How much data can be sent across a network while respecting bandwidth limits.\n",
    "- Project scheduling: Allocation of limited resources to tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "### Methods of the algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "In a directed graph where edges have capacities, the goal is to determine the maximum amount of \"flow\" that can pass from a source vertex (s) to a sink vertex (t) without exceeding the capacities of the edges and ensuring flow conservation at intermediate nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dinitz's algorithm enhanced the MFP efficiency by introducing a layered graph approach and processing the flow in stages, by implementing both BFS and DFS:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using BFS it constructs a so called 'level graph' -  where nodes are assigned levels based on the shortest distance from the source node (s).\n",
    "- Using DFS it augments flow in the level graph. The algorithm uses the concept of a 'blocking flow' -  the blocking flow is a flow where all paths are saturated or all augmenting paths have been exhausted in the level graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm finds valid paths from source to sink. Then the algorithm iterates through multiple DFS until a blocking flow is reached. It repeats the process of finding valid paths and augumenting flow until there is no valid path from source to sink. The sum of all the flows sent through the DFS's is the desired maximum flow of a given graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "### Time complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm's complexity in the below form is: $O(V^2E)$ because:\n",
    "- each BFS level graph can be constructed in $O(E)$ time\n",
    "- a blocking flow can be found by multiple DFS's in at most $O(VE)$ time\n",
    "\n",
    "So the flow of one layer can be computed in $O(E)+O(VE) = O(VE)$ time, and since the maximum number of needed BFS level graphs cannot exceed V, it brings the algorithm's total complexity to $O(V^2E)$.\n",
