        "The **Stable Matching Problem** involves finding a stable way to pair members of two groups (e.g., men and women) based on their preferences. Stability means there are no two individuals who would prefer each other over their current partners, avoiding so-called **blocking pairs**.\n",
        "\n",
        "This problem is often modeled using a bipartite graph, where edges represent preferences between the two groups. A solution ensures that everyone is matched in a way that satisfies stability.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Gale-Shapley Algorithm\n",
        "The **Gale-Shapley algorithm** solves this problem efficiently:\n",
        "1. One group (e.g., men) proposes to their most preferred partner.\n",
        "2. The other group (e.g., women) tentatively accepts the best proposal while rejecting less preferred ones.\n",
        "3. The process continues until no unmatched individuals remain.\n",
        "\n",
        "This algorithm guarantees a **stable matching**, is efficient (\\(O(n^2)\\)), and is widely used in practical applications like university admissions and job markets.\n",
