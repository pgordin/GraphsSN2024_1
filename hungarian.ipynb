    "The **Hungarian Algorithm** (also known as the Munkres-Kuhn Algorithm) is a combinatorial optimization algorithm for solving the **assignment problem**. The assignment problem involves finding the most optimal way to pair items from two sets (e.g., workers to tasks) such that the total cost is minimized (or profit maximized) while ensuring a one-to-one assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works on a cost matrix, where each entry represents the cost of assigning a specific task to a specific worker.\n",

    "The assignment problem is equivalent to finding a maximum-weight matching in a weighted bipartite graph. In the context of a bipartite graph:\n",
    "* One set of nodes represents workers.\n",
    "* The other set represents tasks.\n",
    "* Edges between nodes represent possible assignments, with weights as the cost (or profit).\n",
    "\n",
