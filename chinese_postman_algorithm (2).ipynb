        "#Chinese postman algorithm\n",
        "###The Chinese Postman Problem is a mathematical problem in graph theory and combinatorial optimization. The goal is to find the shortest closed path or circuit that visits every edge of a connected, undirected graph at least once.\n",
        "● If the graph has an Eulerian circuit, meaning a closed walk that covers every edge exactly once, then that circuit is the optimal solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "● If the graph does not have an Eulerian circuit, then the problem becomes finding the smallest number of edges to duplicate (or the subset of edges with the minimum total weight) so that the resulting multigraph does have an Eulerian circuit.\n",
        "\n",
        "This problem differs from the Traveling Salesman problem because the postman can repeat visited nodes and must visit every edge, whereas the salesman cannot repeat nodes and does not have to visit every edge. The Chinese Postman Problem can be solved in polynomial time, unlike the Traveling Salesman Problem, which is NP-hard."
